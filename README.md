# UWSN-Image-Compression-Using-ML
A project description for image compression in an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) using machine learning (ML) could focus on leveraging ML algorithms to compress images captured by UWSNs, reducing storage and transmission needs in resource-constrained underwater environments.
